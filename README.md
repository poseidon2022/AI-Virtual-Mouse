**General Computer Vision Projects**

Created a simple virtual mouse using libraries such as opencv, mediapipe and autopy. Feel free to refine the project and suggest anything that I should consider adding. I also implemented a custom facemesh, face detection and hand tracking module using the mediapipe and opencv libraries.
